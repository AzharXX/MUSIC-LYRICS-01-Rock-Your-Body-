# MUSIC-LYRICS-01-Rock-Your-Body-
In that code I built lyrics printer which will be printed in Terminal with the pace of music! I used Python to build this. In that code I have assigned timing with terminal in output.

1. I install rich while using pip
2. I imported lylics
3. Run the file after saving it
4. You can customize your timing in it as per the Music Pace.
